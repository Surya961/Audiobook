# Audiobook
A little audiobook converter I put together.

The code is somewhat buggy and often may not work as intended. I only made this so I can dictate a nice narration of the story I am currently working on. 

I usually do not exceed narrating any more than 50 pages at a time and even then it tends to overshoot or undershoot. 

Depending on the PC setup one has, it can also take a considerable amount of time for conversion to complete. 

The portable executable tends to get flagged by antivirus software, especially Windows Defender.

Under such cases go through the Python code provided here and build it using pyinstaller yourself.

I'll give the same advice to Linux and Mac users.

Use it at your own risk if you must.

Feedback and constructive criticism would be well-appreciated.
